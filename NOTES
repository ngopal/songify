## Downsampling code:
ffmpeg -i "videoplayback.mp4" -vf fps=1/60 -f image2 "video-frame%03d.png"

## Steps to MVP
1. write server
2. get data into SQL (if playlist in DB, then don't re-parse or hit API)
3.

## TODO
1. Consider training my own "lyrics" models in spacy
2. Add "mood" processing for frames from video to match to music

## Good Coding Practices to Follow
1. Add logging
2.


## Algorithmic Considerations
# NLP Side
1. Try LDA or LDA2Vec
2. Doc2Vec
3. TF-IDF?

# Signaling Processing
1. Include SP data from Spotify?

# Image Analysis Side
1. Train own NN on videos and tags

## Pivot Consideration
1. Brand recognition
2.
