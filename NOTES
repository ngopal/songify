## Downsampling code:
ffmpeg -i "videoplayback.mp4" -vf fps=1/60 -f image2 "video-frame%03d.png"

## Steps to MVP
1. write server
2. get data into SQL (if playlist in DB, then don't re-parse or hit API)
3.

## TODO
1. Consider training my own "lyrics" models in spacy
2. Add "mood" processing for frames from video to match to music

## Good Coding Practices to Follow
1. Add logging
2.


## Algorithmic Considerations
# NLP Side
1. Try LDA or LDA2Vec
2. Doc2Vec
3. TF-IDF?

# Signaling Processing
1. Include SP data from Spotify?

# Image Analysis Side
1. Train own NN on videos and tags

## Pivot Consideration
1. Brand recognition
2.


## Data Story
#
# Wedding Videographer:
# John is a wedding videographer and he has footage, as well as a playlist from the newlyweds...
# A playlist...with 1000 songs. This app helps John find the right song for the right clip using
# a combination of context from the video, as well as the topic of the songs in the playlist
#
# Terry the Animator:
# Terry is an animator. He needs to edit thousands of frames this weekend and he also needs to find the right music
# to set as the background. His client has provided 250 songs, which he has no time to go through. In fact, the songs
# are primarily from an esoteric genre called Emocore, which he is not an expert in. This app will help Terry find the
# right song to use for his video.
