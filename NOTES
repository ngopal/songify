## Downsampling code:
ffmpeg -i "videoplayback.mp4" -vf fps=1/60 -f image2 "video-frame%03d.png"

## Steps to MVP
1. write server
2. Beat 100 song limit on Spotify (ask Rebecca)

## TODO
1. Consider training my own "lyrics" models in spacy
2. Add "mood" processing for frames from video to match to music
3. Refactor Models into Models Package
4. Refactor helpers into Helpers Package
5. Diagnostics/Performance package to look at image_keywords and how they map in space
-- Evaluate how well lyric lines from songs match up to vector space.

## Good Coding Practices to Follow
1. Add logging
2. Add Tests
3. Add comments for context
4. Add README that explains structure of code
5. Name variables in easily interpretable ways

## Data
1. Write function to pull audio_analysis data into related SQL table


## Algorithmic Considerations
# NLP Side
1. Try LDA or LDA2Vec
2. Doc2Vec
3. TF-IDF?
4. Denis Willet suggested TSNE and then clustering, and then showing that selected songs are within topic/genre

# Signaling Processing
1. Include SP data from Spotify?

# Image Analysis Side
1. Train own NN on videos and tags

## Pivot Consideration
1. Brand recognition
2.
